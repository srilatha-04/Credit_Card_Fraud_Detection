# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
## Problem Statement
##### *Developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The model should maximize accuracy, precision, and recall, while minimizing false positives and negatives. The solution should be scalable, robust, and capable of real-time prediction.
##### *In this project, we will analyse customer-level data which has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group.
## DataSets Used
##### 1.Balanced And Structured Data(python file:credit_card D1.py)
##### 2.Unbalanced And Structured Data(python file:credit_cardD2.py)
##### 3.Unbalanced with Categorical Data(python file:credit_cardD3.py)
